    "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both methods used to represent categorical variables as numerical data, but they differ in their approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding is a technique that assigns a unique integer value to each category, but these values are assigned in order based on the category's rank or order. For example, if we have a categorical variable of T-shirt sizes (S, M, L, XL), we could assign them as (0, 1, 2, 3) where \"S\" has the lowest value and \"XL\" has the highest.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Label encoding is a technique that assigns a unique integer value to each category without considering the order. For example, if we have a categorical variable of colors (red, green, blue), we could assign them as (0, 1, 2), where each color is assigned a unique number.\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing between these two techniques, it is important to consider the nature of the categorical variable. If the variable has a clear order or ranking, like in the case of T-shirt sizes, then ordinal encoding would be more appropriate. However, if the variable has no inherent order, like in the case of colors, then label encoding would be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we are working with a dataset of movie ratings where the ratings are on a scale from 1 to 5 (where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest), then ordinal encoding would be appropriate. On the other hand, if we are working with a dataset of movie genres where there is no inherent order, then label encoding would be more appropriate."

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables in a way that captures the monotonic relationship between the variable and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps for Target Guided Ordinal Encoding are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each category of the categorical variable, calculate the mean of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sort the categories in ascending order based on the mean of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign an ordinal number to each category, starting from 1 for the category with the lowest mean of the target variable and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace the original categorical variable with the assigned ordinal numbers.\n",
    "For example, consider a dataset containing information about houses, including the size of the house and the sale price. The categorical variable \"Neighborhood\" has five categories: \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", and \"E\". The mean sale price for each category is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighborhood A: 200,000\n",
    "Neighborhood B: 220,000\n",
    "Neighborhood C: 250,000\n",
    "Neighborhood D: 280,000\n",
    "Neighborhood E: 300,000\n",

    "Using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding, we would assign the following ordinal numbers to each category:\n",

    "Neighborhood A: 1\n",
    "Neighborhood B: 2\n",
    "Neighborhood C: 3\n",
    "Neighborhood D: 4\n",
    "Neighborhood E: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we would replace the original categorical variable with the assigned ordinal numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can be useful in machine learning projects when dealing with categorical variables that have a monotonic relationship with the target variable. This encoding can capture the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable, which can improve the performance of some machine learning models. However, it is important to note that this encoding may not work well for categorical variables with a non-monotonic relationship with the target variable."
